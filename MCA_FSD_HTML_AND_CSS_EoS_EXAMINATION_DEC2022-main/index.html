That night, Þrym says that he is surprised to find his bride-to-be ferociously eating and drinking, consuming nine entrees—one ox and eight salmon—and three casks of mead. Loki responds that "Freyja" had neither drank nor eaten for eight nights before this one as she was so eager to come to Jötunheimr.[12]

            Þrym lifts "Freyja"’s bridal veil to kiss her, only to spring back: The bride’s eyes were "terrifying", as if "fire is burning from them". The disguised Loki explains this was because "Freyja" had not slept for eight nights before this one, because she was so eager to arrive in Jötunheim (on the topic of the numbers three and nine in Norse myth</p>

          One of many armour sets in Assassin's Creed Valhalla, the Thor set is perhaps the most difficult and time intensive in the game
            - which each piece requiring either tough battles or prerequisites to find.

          <p>The etymology of the hammer's name, Mjǫllnir, is disputed among historical linguists. 
            Old Norse Mjǫllnir developed from Proto-Norse *melluniaR and one proposed derivation connects this form to Old 
            Church Slavonic mlunuji and Russian molnija meaning 'lightning' (either borrowed from a Slavic source or both stemming 
            from a common source) and subsequently yielding the meaning 'lightning-maker'
